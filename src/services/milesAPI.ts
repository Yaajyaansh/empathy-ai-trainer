// This file will be used to integrate with Sesame AI's Miles API
// For MVP, we're using mock responses, but this would be replaced with actual API calls

/*
 * IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR SESAME AI'S MILES API INTEGRATION:
 * 
 * When ready to connect to the actual Miles API:
 * 
 * 1. Replace the mock implementation in this file with actual API calls to Sesame AI's endpoints
 *
 * 2. Update the initialize method to store the actual API key securely
 *
 * 3. Update the simulateCustomerInteraction method to:
 *    - Send the employee response to Miles API
 *    - Include context about the scenario and previous interactions
 *    - Parse and return Miles' simulated customer response
 *
 * 4. Update the getFeedback method to:
 *    - Send the entire conversation context to Miles
 *    - Include expected behaviors and evaluation criteria
 *    - Parse Miles' structured feedback into the Feedback type format
 *
 * 5. Consider adding error handling and retry logic for API reliability
 *
 * 6. Implement proper API request authentication following Sesame AI's documentation
